Basic program to encrypt and decrypt messages!
This is super basic encryption so dont trust your darkest secrets with it ;)

keygen.py generates the key.
main.py will encrypt and decrypt your messages.

If you want to encrypt, it will ask for the key you generated and the message you want to encrypt. You will then get your encrypted message!
If you want to decrypt, it will ask for the key and the encrypted message, it will then decrypt and give you the original message.
